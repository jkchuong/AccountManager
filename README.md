# Account Manager

This project uses WPF and SQL to create program that allows the user to register and log in to an account.

<u>Sprint 1</u>

- Created the 3 layers of the application - WPF GUI, SQL Database, and a Business layer in between to help the to communicate 
- Chess Game Engine (CGE) began construction, being built first in the Console before being wired up to the application.

<u>Retrospect</u>

What went well: Creating Login/Registration system was simple, planning of the GUI helped progression.

What didn't went well: Lack of planning for the CGE meant the start was slow.

What to change next time: Ensure I have a clearer idea of how the software will proceed before writing code. 

<u>Sprint 2</u>

- Added dynamically generated game area with colour scheme drawn from database
- Completed ability to move pieces in CGE

<u>Retrospect</u>

What went well: CGE progress fast after planning was done. 

What didn't go well: Not keeping within the scope of the Sprint

What to change next time: Work only on tasks inside Sprint Log.

<u>Sprint 3</u>
